# cpp_inventory_part_structures
The Inventory Part Structures Program (C++) utilizes a loop to ask the user to enter a part number (string), part name (string), part class (char), in stock quantity (int), and unit cost (double). Once the user is done entering part details, the program writes the inventory part structures out to a txt file.
